# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests and responses, and practice building a simple API for managing resources.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new Python project and install FastAPI. Create a basic FastAPI application with a root endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Initialize a Python project and install FastAPI
- Create a main application file (e.g., main.py)
- Implement a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a JSON welcome message


### 🛠️	Task 2: Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Design and implement RESTful endpoints for a simple resource (e.g., items, books, or users). Support Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using FastAPI routes.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a resource model using Pydantic
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources
- Return appropriate status codes and JSON responses for each operation


### 🛠️	Task 3: Add Data Validation and Error Handling (Optional)

#### Description
Enhance your API by adding input validation and error handling to ensure robust and user-friendly endpoints.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Validate incoming data using Pydantic models
- Handle common errors (e.g., resource not found, invalid input)
- Return clear error messages and status codes
